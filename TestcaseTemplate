What is test case?
------------------
A test case is a set of steps that are designed to verify the correctness of 
a particular functionality of a software application. 

Test cases typically consist of two main components: the “actual result” 
and the “expected result.”

Actual Result
-----------------
This is the output that is obtained when the test case is executed.

Expected Result
-----------------
This is the predefined output or behavior that the tester expects 
to observe when the test case is executed correctly.
